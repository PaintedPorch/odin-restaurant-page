JS Logic:

index.js will contain the loading logic and will handle all the imports. This
file will be used to gather all recourses and load them with as little as possible
extra code

home.js will be the default loading standard and it will contain the layout for 
the home page. This layout will be placed within a function to make it which will
be exported and then used in index.js

menu.js works the same but for the menu section

contact.js works the same but for the content section

------

A handy tactic for production is making the layout in HTML first and then creating
it in JS, after that you can export the JS result and import it into index.js.
The Home-page navbar's option will contain event listeners that will activate the
functions to its same-named page, pressing Menu should use the function exported
from menu.js. We can use a variable to make this work and save which page is pressed
or we can try to make home.js the default load state.
