# odin-restaurant-page
My rendition of the TOP restaurant page project

This project is a sample restaurant page made using tabular scrolling. It is themed off a french fine dining restaurant. La Saveur, meaning "The Flavour" in French is a sample name that came to me when I was using a french dictionary to find culinary terms that sounded like the would work as a fine-dining name. (Sorry if you wanted a personal backstory for the name, it seems my French level would not allow for that).
